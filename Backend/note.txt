# Edge Cases
 - if one or more users have the same book with same title, they must be able to create the book
 - but one user cannot create a book with the same title
 - I have to look at this Edge Cases later (take note)

# - users should be able to create multiple books

-------------------

# In this example: Pagination

# page represents the current page number.
# pageSize represents the number of records to be displayed on each page.
# The take parameter is set to pageSize + 1 to fetch one extra record beyond the current page size. 
# If the length of the result set is greater than the pageSize, it means there are more records available.

# The hasMore variable is set based on whether there are more records beyond the current page. 
# If hasMore is true, it indicates that there are more records, 
# and you can use this information to display a "Load More" button or implement other pagination controls in your UI.
